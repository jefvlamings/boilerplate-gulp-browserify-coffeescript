# Boilerplate for Gulp + Browserify + Coffeescript + HAML + SASS
Minimal setup for building modular javascript apps with Coffeescript, HAML and SASS
- HAML compilation to HTML
- Coffeescript compilation to JS
- SASS compilation to CSS
- Separate build directory for easy deployments
- Uglify to obscure and minify javascript 
- Browserify for bundling modules with require()
- Gulp watch for incremental builds (compiling on save)
- Growl notifications

## Getting started
Install node modules with `npm`
```sh
$ npm install
```
Compile and watch assets with `gulp`
```sh
$ gulp
```
